        <p class="news-text">
          ðŸ”¹ Demographic checks are still inconsistent.  Also alerts are not being reviews at check in and removed when outdated.
        </p>

        <p class="news-text">
          ðŸ”¹ Other pets, other pets, other pets!  (Make sure to update info- living vs deceased, other vet, rehomed, make vaxx update appt! ... )
        </p>

        <p class="news-text">
          ðŸ”¹ Please assist the client with weights if needed.  If you notice a dramatic change, reweigh the patient.  Please enter accurate weight.
        </p>

        <p class="news-text">
          ðŸ”¹ When clients call for preventatives:  Please check all patients and all preventatives.  Not just what they are asking for.
        </p>

        <p class="news-text">
          ðŸ”¹ Surgery reminders:  Please call the client the day before (no text or email).  Confirm drop off time, no food after midnight, water is OK!
        </p>

        <p class="news-text">
          ðŸ”¹ Surgery drop offs please monitor if they aren't here by 8:20-*:30 please start calling.  This put the surgery team behind waiting for admits.
        </p>

        <p class="news-text">
          ðŸ”¹ Make sure the kennel has walkie-talkies on them every morning.  Also you guys have yours in the morning.  Karen should have one as well.
        </p>

        <p class="news-text">
          ðŸ”¹ Prescription pick-ups.  Please review all instructions with clients, make sure everything lines up with instructions, quantities, etc.  Same for prevention!
        </p>
        <p class="news-text">
          ðŸ”¹ Clients that are calling first thing in the morning for medical should be offered earlier rather than later.  We do not want to be working up medical appointments late in the afternoon.  Clients can always be offered a drop off if necessary.  Although, give them the expectation they will need to talk with a tech at drop off and get a treatment plan.
        </p>

        <p class="news-text">
          ðŸ”¹ Time off calendar - please refer to it when needing time off.  Everyone that requests gets approved and then written on the calendar.  Unfortunately, due to our small staff now and the hot mess of time off calendar there will be no more requests for time off through the end of August.  Saturday rotations are published in Sling through August if you need time off swap with coworker within the week.
        </p>

          ðŸ”¹ post meeting:  updated general emergency tx plans (AR & RW) to reflect current in-house (emergency) BW panels for each species, and also include a baseline expectation for x-rays and supportive care.  Tx plans are intended to give general expectation of care until pt is triaged and custom plan created.
