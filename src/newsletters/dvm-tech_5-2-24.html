          Employment News!
        </h4>

        <p class="news-text">
          ðŸ”¹ Amie is back!!!!  Working part time, in between CSR and Outpatient.  She is excited to be back and easing herself back into the family.  We are excited to have our old Amie back!
        </p>
        <p class="news-text">
          ðŸ”¹ Ava is back on June 1st!!! She will be here until August 20th.  She was finally accepted to Long Island Vet School!!!
        </p>
        <p class="news-text">
          ðŸ”¹ Adam will be training as an outpatient assistant starting at the end of May.  He will be doing every other Saturday, and some Friday afternoons.
        </p>

        <h4 class="news-subheader">
          General Reminders/Notes
        </h4>
        <p class="news-text">
          ðŸ”¹ We all are doing better watching the first invoice posting date!!!
        </p>
        <p class="news-text">
          ðŸ”¹ Tech Appointments - Patients must have been seen for wellness within 3 months with DVM.  Only for boostering Lyme or Lepto or Bordetella (never all 3).  Tech can not booster distemper or rabies.  Also patients either go into the exam room or come back to treatment.  No injections of any kind should be happening in the reception or store. 
        </p>
        <p class="news-text">
          ðŸ”¹ We still have inconsistency with puppy and kitten vaccine series.  Please follow the protocol.  It is posted right in the pharmacy area.  I have handed out at a few meetings as well.  First time here should always be DAP or HCP initial.  Think of it as it is our initial vaccine, regardless of the previous vaccine history.  Also regardless of previous vaccines the last distemper is given at 20 weeks.  Visit should include preventatives and first visit always a fecal.  We need to stay consistent and use the recheck 4 week line item and make a note of what was discussed for the next visit so that techs are on the same page.  Pyrantel every time!
        </p>

        <h4 class="news-subheader">
          Surgery Reminders
        </h4>
        <p class="news-text">
          ðŸ”¹ When recommending and scheduling dentals please make notes if extractions are expected.  We need to schedule these better.  We can start doing more routine cleanings.  Also if feline or canine.
        </p>
        <p class="news-text">
          ðŸ”¹ Dogs over 1 year and/or have gone through their first heat needs to have mature spay added to their treatment plan.
        </p>
        <p class="news-text">
          ðŸ”¹ PAP exams patients over 7 years should only be getting Health Check Plus (cats) or Total Health Plus (dogs) they do not get PreAnesthetic panel
        </p>

        <h4 class="news-subheader">
          Outpatient Reminders
        </h4>
        <p class="news-text">
          ðŸ”¹ We need to make sure we are fully completing all glossary questions at every appointment.  I am noticing a trend we are not looking ahead and prefilling in the preventative purchase history.  We are not asking when clients gave preventatives last, and we are not offering preventatives when due.
        </p>
        <p class="news-text">
          ðŸ”¹Credelio 6 doses should be sold under 6 packs.  I have been fixing a few invoices where we sent home a 6 pack but charged them for 6 individual doses.  There is a cost savings for the client of almost $70!!!
        </p>
        <p class="news-text">
          ðŸ”¹Starting in June Rosemary is extending appointments to the last one being at 5:20.  We will have assistants every night in June.  The reason being our appointments and cash flow is down about 25%.  We recognize this is industry wide, and the economy isn't the greatest. But we need to be able to pay our bills and obviously the amazing staff we have working here!  Here is a visual for the past 3 years in the month of April for patient visits.</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="news-list">2022 - 475</li>
            <li class="news-list">2023 - 713 (238 more appts from 2022)</li>
            <li class="news-list">2024 - 537 (176 LESS appts from 2023)</li>
          </ul>

        <p class="news-text">
          ðŸ”¹ In order to kill ourselves (ðŸ™„ðŸ¤£) and do appointments consistently between techs we all need to follow the same flow.  Our clients should have the same experience from tech to tech and get the exact same recommendations.  We also need to be using assistants all the same.  2 techs share one assistant.  Assistants are all at different training levels and career paths.  Unfortunately the group currently are not here long term so we are helping them gain experience.  But not spending a lot of time training them how to do all parts outpatient.
        </p>
        <p class="news-text">
          ðŸ”¹ Tech checks in appointments, asks appropriate appointment glossary questions, recommends appropriate bloodwork (preventative vs. sick), and discusses preventatives.
        </p>
        <p class="news-text">
          ðŸ”¹Tech borrows patient for blood and nail trims (done prior to DVM going in).  We should not be drawing blood in the exam room.  Reason being we have assistants training and might need guidance which isnâ€™t appropriate giving in front of client.  Most of the exam tables patients can not be properly restrained for blood draws.  Also if more assistants are needed it can be awkward to bring more support into the exam room.  We have a strict 2 poke rule then swap out must happen.
        </p>
        <p class="news-text">
          ðŸ”¹ Assistant draws up vaccines for appointment while tech preps DVM, and or starting posting services and preventatives.
        </p>
      <p class="news-text">
        ðŸ”¹ Assistant goes in with DVM to restrain
      </p>
      <p class="news-text">
        ðŸ”¹ DVM finishes and touches base with Tech about more services / products (writing them down).
      </p>
      <p class="news-text">
        ðŸ”¹ When services and treatments are recommended, treatment plans should be presented to the client regardless if the patient is staying or not.  Client needs to sign a treatment plan, then it is scanned into medical records.  Once treatment plans have been presented to the client they do not get erased.  DVM when making recommendations please write down on the check in sheet so accurate treatment plans are made.
      </p>
      <p class="news-text">
        ðŸ”¹ We still have several appointments not being written up.  All appointment notes must be complete before the end of the day.  DVM please date/time stamp your initials.  Tech when transcribing Dr. Moffat use your date/time stamp then say for SM.  This is especially frustrating for staff when the DVM isn't here. The patient has a medical issue, client calls for help and we don't know what was discussed, or recommended for next steps.
      </p>
      <p class="news-text">
        ðŸ”¹ In house lab chart has been made.  I hope every option is listed.  I have noticed several times we are over charging though.  There are profiles including T4/SDMA we shouldn't be using separate line item.
        <!-- LINK to LAB CHART ONCE MADE!!  -->
      </p>
      <p class="news-text">
        ðŸ”¹ I learned the other day that after every use of UA analyzer the black tray needs to be pulled out, run under water and dried, then put back in.  This is why I couldn't get calibration to run, the tray was dirty.
      </p>
      <p class="news-text">
        ðŸ”¹ We need to take our time entering information into the radiography program.  Many things can be edited after but if a patient is entered under the wrong patient and or wrong date tech support is needed at $207 per call it can add up.  Please take your time and pay attention.
      </p>
      <p class="news-text">
        ðŸ”¹ Please make sure when putting away orders you are looking every time for an inventory tag, and putting them on the correct item, in the correct spot (ex. Deramaxx 75mg last 3 bottles, it is put on the 3rd to last bottle).  Also when taking items to dispense if you noticed we are low or out please check the needs list to make sure it got put on.
      </p>
      <p class="news-text">
        ðŸ”¹ We are now carrying generic Cerenia call Maropitant
      </p>
      <p class="news-text">
        ðŸ”¹ When clients are starting Proin, dispense first bottle here, then instruct them to request through online pharmacy as it is much more cost effective for them
      </p>
      <p class="news-text">
        ðŸ”¹ When refilling prescriptions it should be going under the DVM that prescribed it or saw the patient last.  But instead of using the DVM name, choose RXM, RXD, or RXC for provided.  This code reports differently.  Food and supplements should always be Kittery Animal Hospital.  Unless going home with client from an appointment
      </p>
      <p class="news-text">
        ðŸ”¹ Saturday techs need to write on white board before leaving who is on call with your number.  The kennel will be looking if there are questions or problems occurring Sunday.  They are to contact tech first then from there determine if DVM is needed.  The Saturday DVM is always on call Sunday.
      </p>

      <h4>Staff Schedules</h4>
      <p class="news-text">
        ðŸ”¹ I appreciate you all looking at time off calendar before requesting time so there are no conflicts.  Our summer is now packed with requests.  Unfortunately thru August no time off will be approved.  I am trying my best to keep everyone's schedule consistent.  If you need a day off here or there please talk with your team to swap the same week.  I will have Saturdays rotations posted thru August by the end of day as well.  Again you need a weekend off when you are working please swap with a team member.
      </p>
      <p class="news-text">
        ðŸ”¹ I appreciate everyone one of you!!!  Things have been crazy with staffing changes.  I appreciate your flexibility and understanding during some very stressful times here.  We are the smallest team we have ever been, and honestly we probably all work the best together.
